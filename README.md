Example of the PandaS DataReader applying the PandaS library and the DataTime system library. 

Reads only the Amazon stock from the Yahoo Finance API.

Uses DateTime to configure the time interval for data to be processed. So this would take the current data as the end_time and the start_data to be exactly a year ago.
